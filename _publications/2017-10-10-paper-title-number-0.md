excerpt: 'We consider data intensive cloud-based stream analytics where data transmission through the underlying communication network is the cause of the performance bottleneck. Two key inter-related problems are investigated: task placement and bandwidth allocation. We seek to answer the following questions. How does task placement make impact on the application-level throughput? Does a careful bandwidth allocation among data flows traversing a bottleneck link results in better performance? In this paper, we address these questions by conducting measurement-driven analysis in a SDN-enabled computer cluster running stream processing applications on top of Apache Storm. The results reveal (i) how tasks are assigned to computing nodes make large difference in application level performance; (ii) under certain task placement, a proper bandwidth allocation helps further improve the performance as compared to the default TCP mechanism; and (iii) task placement and bandwidth allocation are collaboratively making effects in overall performance.'

<i> Abstract: </i> 

We consider data intensive cloud-based stream analytics where data transmission through the underlying communication network is the cause of the performance bottleneck. Two key inter-related problems are investigated: task placement and bandwidth allocation. We seek to answer the following questions. How does task placement make impact on the application-level throughput? Does a careful bandwidth allocation among data flows traversing a bottleneck link results in better performance? In this paper, we address these questions by conducting measurement-driven analysis in a SDN-enabled computer cluster running stream processing applications on top of Apache Storm. The results reveal (i) how tasks are assigned to computing nodes make large difference in application level performance; (ii) under certain task placement, a proper bandwidth allocation helps further improve the performance as compared to the default TCP mechanism; and (iii) task placement and bandwidth allocation are collaboratively making effects in overall performance.
