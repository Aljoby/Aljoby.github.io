Education
======
* B.Sc in Computer Information Systems, Hashemite University, Jordan (1st Class Honours), 2008
* M.Sc. in Computer Engineering, Jordan University of Science and Technology, Jordan, 2013 
* Ph.D. in Computer Science, National University of Singapore, Singapore, 2020

Work experience
======
* Postdoctoral Research Fellow (Full-time) (Dec. 2020 - Present)
  * National University of Singapore
  * Research focus: Enabling In-Network Detection and Mitigation of Adaptive Link Flooding Attacks (LFA). This kind of attack is TCP-conforming under which the botnet sends a stealthy low-rate traffic regulated by TCP congestion control. We leverage the flexibility of SDN programmable data plane to defend against this attack via traffic engineering techniques.

* Research Intern (Part-time) (Aug. 2019 - Dec. 2019)
  * Advance Digital Sciences Center, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC)
  * Gained knowledge about the cyber attack scenarios targeting the smart grid power system. Specifically, the attacks that could be launched against infrastructure of an electric power substation during GOOSE-based data transmission between substationâ€™s IEDs.
  
Skills
======
* Languages (P4, Assembly, C, C++, Java, .NET, MATLAB)
* Web & DBMS (XML, HTML, PHP, JavaScript, SQLServer, MySQL)
* Microprocessors Simulators (SESC, WinDLX, XEEMO)
* Network Simulators (Scapy, Mininet, NS2, OMNET++)
